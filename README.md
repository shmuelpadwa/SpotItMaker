# SpotItMaker

Hi, I'm Shmuel, and this my Spot It Maker. Patent Pending.

This project was done after a dentist appointment on 1/29/2020, when I was unmotivated to do homework and unable to eat due to the dental stuff.
It uses fixed projective planes to generate the numbers.

This is not the first spot it maker available, and you can find a far better one at http://aaronbarker.net/spot-it/spot-it.html
Still, I like it.

Spot It is a game with 57 symbols and 57 cards, each card with 8 symbols, such that each pair of cards share a symbol.
This simple children's game has a lot of math behind it, especially with fixed projective planes.

So a fixed projective planes has three properties: no four collinear points, any two lines meet at one and only one point, and any two points are one one and only one line.
THere isn't a definition of "point" or "line." So we can call symbols "points" and cards "lines."

Enjoy!
